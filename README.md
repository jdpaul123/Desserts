Hi,
<br><br>
  &emsp; I'm excited to submit and share my take home project for the Fetch iOS Engineer position. I have had a great time considering the architecture, testability, and UI of this app as I planned and built it. If you have any questions about my thought process, code, or design please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for this opportunity!
<br><br>
Best,
<br>
JD Paul

## Usage
1. Download the .zip for this repo.
2. Open the Desserts.xcodeproj file in Xcode.
3. Press Cmd+R to run the project in a iPhone or iPad simulator or physical device.

## Software and Language Versions
* Xcode: 15.1
* Swift: 5.9
* iOS target version: 17.2

## Features meeting requirements:
* The app gets data from the two endpoints outlined in the project specification to get the list of desserts and then the details about the dessert:
https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert
https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID
* Desserts are sorted alphabetically in DataServiceâ€™s getDesserts() method.
* The list of desserts are displayed in the DessertListScreen.
* The meal name, instructions, and ingredients/measurements of each dessert are displayed in the DessertDetailScreen.
* Null values from the API are filtered out in the DataService method getDessertDetails(for:).
* The app only utilizes first-party frameworks that come with Xcode. No packages were used to aid development.

## Features exceeding requirements:
### Architecture
* The app's architecture follows MVVM principles.
* The app utilizes principles of dependency injection avoiding hidden dependencies by passing them in to class/struct initializers and function parameters.
* There is a network and data service to seperate concerns between parts of the app. It decouples the view from the network and data logic making the app more maintainable and testable.
* The service classes conform to protocols in order to allow for the creation of mock versions when unit testing.
* The views utilize composable SwiftUI views to modularize the parts that are used to build each screen. This allows views such as the Loading View to be used on both the Dessert List Screen and the Dessert Detial Screen.

### Testing
* Unit tests are written to verify the functionality of DefaultNetworkService using the XCTest framework.
* A mock version of URLSession is used to isolate the system under test, DefaultNetworkService, and simulate different responses from URLSession.
* A data stub class is used to provide data for the tests.
* The tests are focused on making sure that functions work as intended when they succeed and fail gracefully (ex. throw an error).
* In the future, tests can be expanded to the other services and view models. Views can be tested using snapshot testing. The Injector class can be built out further to accomidate injecting mock versions of dependencies for cleaner testing.

### User Interface
* Dessert Images: The app loads images in both the DessertListScreen and DessertDetailScreen in order to provide a better user experience. There is logic in the DessertListScreenViewModel to make sure images are only ever loaded once to avoid unnecessary hardware stress and internet data usage.
* Search Bar: There is a search bar on the DessertListScreen to allow for quicker access when the user already knows what dessert recipe you want to find.
* Error Banner Modifier: There is an error banner modifier to show an error banner over the current view with a message about the error any time there is an error in the app (seen in the middle image below).

There are 3 possible screen states as data is loaded and formatted:
1. Loading state which animates the app icon as a loading indicator
2. Failed state which displays an error banner when the app fails to get the data and allows the user to pull-to-refresh the data. This would be useful if the user is not connected to internet then connects to the internet then pulls to refresh the data.
3. Success state which shows the data (ie. the Dessert List Screen or Dessert Detail Screen)
